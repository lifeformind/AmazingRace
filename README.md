## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

The location-based multi-player webapp employs a modern three-tier architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and optimal mobile performance. The architecture separates concerns across presentation, application logic, and data persistence layers while incorporating real-time communication capabilities and external service integrations.

The presentation layer consists of a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with React, providing responsive mobile interfaces optimized for touch interaction and offline capabilities. This layer handles user interface rendering, GPS location management, real-time communication display, and multimedia content presentation including augmented reality features.

The application logic layer implements a RESTful API server using Flask, managing business logic, user authentication, team coordination, race progression, and puzzle validation. This layer orchestrates data flow between the presentation layer and persistence layer while maintaining security boundaries and implementing caching strategies for optimal performance.

The data persistence layer utilizes PostgreSQL for structured data storage with Redis for session management and real-time data caching. This combination provides ACID compliance for critical race data while enabling high-performance access to frequently requested information such as user sessions and team communications.

Real-time communication capabilities are implemented through WebSocket connections managed by Socket.IO, enabling instant message delivery, location updates, and progress notifications. The WebSocket server integrates with the main application server to maintain consistency between real-time events and persistent data storage.

### Architecture Patterns and Principles

The system architecture follows several key design patterns that ensure maintainability, scalability, and reliability. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates data models, user interface components, and business logic controllers, enabling independent development and testing of each layer.

Microservices principles guide the decomposition of application functionality into discrete, loosely coupled services. Core services include user management, team coordination, race management, puzzle delivery, and real-time communication. Each service maintains its own data models and exposes well-defined APIs for inter-service communication.

Event-driven architecture patterns enable loose coupling between system components through asynchronous message passing. Location updates, puzzle completions, and team communications trigger events that propagate through the system, updating relevant components without tight coupling between event producers and consumers.

The Repository pattern abstracts data access logic, providing consistent interfaces for database operations while enabling easy testing through mock implementations. This pattern facilitates database technology changes and supports multiple data sources for different types of information.

### Component Architecture

#### Frontend Architecture

The React-based frontend implements a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns between presentation components, container components, and service layers. Presentation components focus solely on rendering user interfaces and handling user interactions, while container components manage state and coordinate with backend services.

State management utilizes Redux for global application state with local component state for UI-specific data. The Redux store maintains user authentication status, team information, race progress, and real-time communication data. Actions and reducers follow functional programming principles to ensure predictable state transitions and enable time-travel debugging.

Routing implementation uses React Router for single-page application navigation with lazy loading of route components to minimize initial bundle size. Protected routes ensure authenticated access to race functionality while public routes handle user registration and general information display.

Service layer abstraction provides consistent interfaces for backend API communication, WebSocket management, and browser API access including geolocation and camera services. This abstraction enables easy testing and provides fallback mechanisms for unsupported browser features.

#### Backend Architecture

The Flask-based backend implements a layered architecture with clear separation between API endpoints, business logic services, and data access layers. API endpoints handle HTTP request processing, input validation, and response formatting while delegating business logic to dedicated service classes.

Business logic services implement core application functionality including user authentication, team management, race progression, and puzzle validation. These services maintain business rules and coordinate between different data sources while remaining independent of specific API implementations.

Data access layers provide abstraction over database operations through repository patterns and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using SQLAlchemy. This approach enables database-agnostic business logic and facilitates testing through mock data access implementations.

Authentication and authorization implementation uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication with role-based access control for administrative functions. Social authentication integration leverages OAuth 2.0 protocols for third-party identity provider support.

The response time commitments include severity classification, priority handling, and communication protocols for effective issue resolution and user satisfaction.

Issue resolution timelines include target resolution times based on issue severity and complexity with regular progress updates and alternative solutions when immediate resolution is not possible. The resolution commitments include workaround provision, temporary solutions, and comprehensive resolution documentation for effective issue management.

Communication protocols include regular status updates, resolution progress reporting, and post-resolution follow-up to ensure user satisfaction and issue closure. The communication includes multiple contact channels, escalation procedures, and feedback collection for continuous service improvement and user satisfaction.

#### Performance Guarantees

Response time guarantees include API response times, page load performance, and real-time communication latency with appropriate monitoring and remediation procedures when performance targets are not met. The performance guarantees include measurement methodologies, reporting procedures, and improvement commitments for consistent user experience.

Scalability commitments include concurrent user support, data volume handling, and system performance under varying load conditions with appropriate capacity planning and scaling procedures. The scalability commitments include load testing, capacity monitoring, and proactive scaling for consistent system performance and user experience.

Data protection guarantees include backup procedures, recovery capabilities, and data integrity measures with appropriate testing and validation procedures. The data protection commitments include backup verification, recovery testing, and data loss prevention measures for comprehensive data security and availability.
